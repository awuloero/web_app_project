This project is a web-based student management system implemented using PHP and MySQL.
It allows users to log in, view, add, update, and delete student records.
The application has two types of users: regular users and administrators.
Regular users can view student data and update their own information, while administrators have additional privileges to add, update, and delete student records.
Security measures such as input validation, output encoding, authentication, and authorization mechanisms are implemented to prevent common web security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and unauthorized access.
Overall, the project provides a secure and efficient way to manage student data for educational institutions or similar organizations.
